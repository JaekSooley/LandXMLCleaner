# LandXMLCleaner
 
A simple console application to remove elements from .XML files.
Comes set up for removing <PlanFeatures> and <SourceData> elements from LandXML files exported from AutoCAD Civil 3D, as they're not needed and can end up hugely bloating surfaces by several MB.
 
 Just drag and drop the .XML file into the console application and press ENTER to start.
 Alternatively, type S or SETTINGS to modify the elements that are to be removed.
